				page, it means that web has not been configured for this domain 
				on this server. <br>
				<br>
				This could be due to the following causes: <br>
				<br>
				<li>Kloxo has not restarted the web server yet after you added the 
				domain. Please wait for the web server to restart. <br>
				<br>
				</li>
				<li>The domain is pointing to the wrong Kloxo server. Ping the domain 
				and make sure that the IP matches one of the IPaddress seen in
				<b>admin home -&gt; ipaddresses </b><br>
				<br>
				</li>
				<li>If you are seeing this page when you try to access an IP like 
				http://192.168.1.1, then that means that the IP has not yet been 
				mapped to a domain. Go to <b>client home -&gt; ipaddresses -&gt; ipaddress 
				home -&gt; domain config </b>and map an IP to a domain. <br>
				<br>
				</li>
				<li>Once you map an IP to a domain, then you have to make sure that 
				the domain pings back to the same IP. Otherwise, if you try to access 
				the domain, you will get this page. So IP -&gt; domain.com should mean 
				that domain.com pings to the same IP. <br>
