There are two types of clients. Resellers and customers. The difference is that Resellers can have customers under them. The smallest unit of authorization in Kloxo is a customer, who can have multiple domains under him. The home directory of a customer is '/home/clientname', and his domain's docroot is /home/clientname/domain.com'. He can also login through ftp using his clientname as the id and the password.
