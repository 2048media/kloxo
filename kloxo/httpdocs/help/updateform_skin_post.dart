 <%program%> has two left panels. One is a tree menu, and the other is the XP like simple foldable group of resources. The Tree Menu is an extremely powerful means to navigate the resources, with full access to the resources at any depth, which can be configured here. The tree menu is also linked with the main listing search, so that if you search for a particular resource in the main lisiting, then the the tree menu will also be limited to the exact same search result. The search parameters are fully remembered across logins--it is a feature we call hyperFiltering--and this enables a veteran user to manage the system with the least number of clicks. But the Tree Menu is a little more complicated than the XP panel and we recommend you switch to the Tree Menu only if you are a power user.

 By Default the scroll bar is disabled on the left panel even for Tree Menu, and you have to enable it manually here.
