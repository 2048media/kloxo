[b] Display Errors [/b]: With this directive set to off, errors that occur during the execution of scripts will no longer be displayed as a part of the script output, and thus, will no longer be exposed to remote users.  With some errors, the error message content may expose information about your script, web server, or database server that may be exploitable for hacking.  Production sites should have this directive set to off.

[b]  Register Globals [/b] :  Global variables are no longer registered for input data (POST, GET, cookies, environment and other server variables).  Instead of using $foo, you must use you can use $_REQUEST["foo"] (includes any variable that arrives through the request, namely, POST, GET and cookie variables), or use one of the specific $_GET["foo"], $_POST["foo"], $_COOKIE["foo"] or $_FILES["foo"], depending on where the input originates.  Also, you can look at the import_request_variables() function.  Note that register_globals is going to be depracated (i.e., turned off by default) in the next version of PHP, because it often leads to security bugs.
