 In the quick add form at the top, the [b] parent domain [/b]  list is intelligent, and will only show the domains that are visible in the [b] domains [/b] page. That is, the search criteria for the [b] domains [/b] page is automatically applied to the [b] parent domain [/b] field. So to add a subdomain to a particular domain, just search for that domain in the domains page, and come here.

 A subdomain is a full fledged domain, and you an do everything you normally do on a domain, including mailboxes. The difference is that a subdomain is not counted toward your domain quota, instead is counted separately. Also, please note that at this point, if you delete a domain, its subdomains are not deleted. You will have to delete them manually.
