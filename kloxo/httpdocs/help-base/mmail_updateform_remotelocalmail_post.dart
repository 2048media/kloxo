This will allow you to tell the mail server that the mail is configured remotely. This is would mean that mails generated in this machine are delivered to a remote server after doing the necessary DNS lookups. If the value is 'local', then the mail will always delivered locally. This is usefull if you have your mail configured on another server.

 If you configure mail as remote and provide the [b] Webmail Url [/b] field here, automatically the [b] webmail [/b] button in the CP will be redirected to that particular address rather than the default [b] webmail.domain.com [/b].

 The [b] Webmail Url [/b] field is completely ignored if the mail is configured locally.
