 
 Mail forwards are virtual email addresses, where mail coming to the address is directly forwarded to the address/script specified here.  Please note that a mailaccount is not created at all, and thus no mail gets stored on the server. If you want to store mails too, you have to create a proper mailaccount and then add forwards from inside it.

 The [b] Forward To [/b] can be a mail address, which would mean that mails coming to the address is transparently sent to it.

 
You can specify the forwarded address as a script. For instance, [b] Mail account [/b] could be [b] incoming@domain.com [/b], and you can set the [b] Forward To [/b] as [b] |/home/clientname/domain.com/myscript.sh [/b], which would mean that mails coming to the address incoming@domain.com would be just fed to the script.
