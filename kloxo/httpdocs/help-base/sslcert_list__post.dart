 To get a certificate from an authority, you will first need to create a CSR. To do that, first create an SSL directly in Kloxo by providing all the necessary information. Kloxo will internally create an SSL Certificate. If you go inside the ssl certificate home page, Kloxo will show you the text values of CSR, KEY, and Certificate. You can copy and send the CSR to the certificate authority and they will send you a Certificate. Upload the KEY, the Certificate-you-got-from-the-authority, and then you will need to get the proper CA file for the authority by finding it out from their help page.

 Once you upload these params, you can set this particular ssl certificate to an ipaddress <url:a=list&c=ipaddress> clicking here </url> and setting it there.
