The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H3 (2.3.5).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application.  It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server.  Supported features include shared
calendars, remote calendars, meeting management, alarms, recurring events, and
a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping
events.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.3.4) are:
    * Minor bug fixes and improvements.
    * Updated Estonian translation.
