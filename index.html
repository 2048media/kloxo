        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>If you go to this page, this probably means that you are interested in contributing to Kloxo by coding and we certainly welcome you. Kloxo is an open-source program which means that evey body have the right to edit the code. In particular, we use a method called <i>Pull Requests</i> to handle codes contributed by the general public.</p>
		
        <h3>To start...</h3>
<p>To start, you should first have your own GitHub developer account. Then, click on the little <i>Fork</i> botton. Right now, a dedicated <em>kloxo</em> fork is created in your account and you're ready to go! LxCenter uses <em>Redmine</em> to track bugs. Therefore, the next step would be going to the <a href="http://project.lxcenter.org" title="bug tracker">bug tracker</a>. Then, click on <em>Kloxo</em>, then <em>Issues</em>. You will be able to see a list of bug, feature requests etc. Choose one that you are interested in and is <strong>not assigned</strong> to anybody. Leave a message that you are right now working on it and officially start your development!</p>
<p>In your own <em>kloxo</em> fork, create a branch called <code><em>{type}-{issue id}</em></code>, for instance, <code><em>bug-1000</em></code>. Right now, you can actually start coding for the issue with any IDE or text editor you like!</p>

		<h3>Coding Standard</h3>
		<p>Every open-source project have its rules for developers and so do LxCenter. Here, it is called <em>Coding Standard</em>. Every developer must follow the standard or your code might not be accepted.</p>
		<p>Serveral important rules are: 1) commit on one single thing at one time; 2) follow the GNU AGPL requirement and; 3) follow general PHP coding standard. The detailed Coding Standard is available on the <a href="http://project.lxcenter.org/projects/kloxo/wiki/Coding_Standards" title="Coding Standard">project site</a>.</p>
		<p>Do also noted that we have specific rules for the commit messages so they are also important.</p>
        
        <h3>When the coding is done...</h3>
        <p>When the coding is done, you should update us at the bug tracker, then submit a <em>Pull Request</em>. Go back to Kloxo's <a href="https://github.com/lxcenter/kloxo" title="Repository">GitHub repository</a>, then click the little <em>Pull Request</em> button on the top right hand corner. In base repo, choose <code><em>lxcenter/kloxo</em></code> and in base branch, choose <code><em>dev</em></code>. In head repo, choose the name of your own fork and in head branch, choose the branch you created for the issue. </p>
        <p>In the title of the <em>Pull Request</em>, you are suggested to put down the title of the issue and the ID of the issue which is availabe on the bug tracker.<code></code></p>

<h3>Core review</h3>

<p>In LxCenter, there is a group of experienced developer called <em>Cores</em> and a memeber is called <em>Core</em>. After submitting the <em>Pull Request</em>, a <em>Core</em> will review your request. Then, they will either approve your request, or else give you comments on how to improve your request. In rare circumstances however, a request may be rejected.</p>

<h3>Benefits for contributing</h3>

<p>If you have made more than 3 <strong>approved <em>Pull Request</em></strong> per three months, you may be entitled to become a <em>LxCenter Representative</em>. A <em>Representative</em> is entitled to be referred with paid support requests LxCenter receives and can made comments on important LxCenter changes.
